jira-cli
	
Manage Jira tickets from the command line using jira-cli. Contains essential setup instructions, non-interactive command patterns with required flags (--plain, --raw, etc.), authentication troubleshooting, and comprehensive command reference. This skill is triggered when the user says things like "create a Jira ticket", "list my Jira issues", "update Jira issue", "move Jira ticket to done", "log time in Jira", "add comment to Jira", or "search Jira issues". IMPORTANT - Read this skill before running any jira-cli commands to avoid blocking in interactive mode.
Jira CLI Setup and Usage

This skill provides instructions for installing and using the Jira CLI tool to interact with Jira from the command line.
Quick Reference: Common Pitfalls to Avoid

Before diving into detailed commands, be aware of these critical points:

    Time Tracking: MUST use jira issue worklog add ISSUE "1m" --new-estimate "1h" - DO NOT use --custom for time tracking
    Cannot log 0m: Logging "0m" causes server errors - always log at least "1m"
    Status Names Vary: "Done" may not exist - use exact status name from error message (e.g., "Resolved", "Closed")
    --no-input Support: Not all commands support --no-input:
        ✓ Supported: issue edit, issue worklog add
        ✗ Not supported: issue move, view/list commands
    Environment Setup: Test jira me --plain first - only source ~/.envrc if auth fails

CRITICAL: Environment Setup

Before running any jira-cli commands, check if the user has already configured their environment.

The user may have already:

    Installed and configured jira-cli
    Set up authentication tokens in environment files (e.g., ~/.envrc, ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc)
    Configured the Jira CLI in ~/.config/.jira/.config.yml
    Exported JIRA_API_TOKEN in their current shell session

Test if jira-cli is already working before sourcing environment files:

# First, try running jira-cli directly
jira me --plain

# If you get authentication errors, THEN check for environment files

Only source environment files if authentication fails:

# If needed, check for and source .envrc conditionally
[ -f ~/.envrc ] && source ~/.envrc 2>/dev/null; jira me --plain

Why this approach:

    The JIRA_API_TOKEN environment variable is required for authentication
    Users may have already sourced their environment files in the current shell
    Users may have tokens configured globally in their shell configuration
    Do not assume ~/.envrc needs to be sourced - only do so if authentication fails
    The user may have already completed the full setup, so test first before suggesting changes

Troubleshooting steps if commands fail:

    First try running jira commands directly (e.g., jira me --plain)
    If authentication fails, check if JIRA_API_TOKEN is set: echo $JIRA_API_TOKEN
    If not set, then try sourcing common environment files like ~/.envrc
    Only suggest installation/configuration if the tool is not found or environment variables cannot be located

IMPORTANT: Preventing Interactive Mode Blocking

ALWAYS use --plain flag (or equivalent non-interactive flags) when running jira-cli commands to prevent the tool from entering interactive mode and blocking execution.
Non-Interactive Flags by Command Type

For listing/viewing commands:

    Use --plain to get plain text output instead of interactive UI
    Alternative non-interactive flags: --raw (JSON output), --csv (CSV output)

For commands that prompt for input (create, edit, worklog):

    Use --no-input to skip interactive prompts
    Commands that support --no-input:
        jira issue edit - skips prompts for fields
        jira issue worklog add - skips comment prompt
        Other create/edit commands
    Commands that DO NOT support --no-input:
        jira issue move - does not have this flag
        Most viewing/listing commands (use --plain instead)

Important:

    If a command doesn't support --no-input, provide all required parameters via flags
    If you get "unknown flag: --no-input" error, remove the flag and provide inputs via other flags
    Always check error messages for available flags

Examples:

# CORRECT - Non-blocking list commands
jira issue list --plain
jira issue list --raw
jira epic list --plain

# CORRECT - Non-blocking edit/worklog commands
jira issue edit PROJ-123 --custom "field=value" --no-input
jira issue worklog add PROJ-123 "1h" --no-input

# CORRECT - Move command (no --no-input flag)
jira issue move PROJ-123 "In Progress"

# INCORRECT - May block in interactive UI
jira issue list
jira epic list
jira issue worklog add PROJ-123 "1h"  # Will prompt for comment

Other Package Managers

Jira CLI is also available via Nix and other package managers. See Repology for a full list.
Configuration
Cloud Server Setup

    Generate a Jira API token at: https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
    Export the token as an environment variable:

    export JIRA_API_TOKEN="your-token-here"

    Note: If environment variables are stored in ~/.envrc, you may need to source them first:

    source ~/.envrc

    Run jira init and select "Cloud" installation type
    Provide your Jira instance URL (e.g., https://your-company.atlassian.net)

On-Premise Installation

    Export authentication credentials:

    export JIRA_API_TOKEN="your-token-here"

    For Personal Access Token (PAT) authentication:

    export JIRA_AUTH_TYPE="bearer"

    Run jira init and select "Local" installation type
    For non-English installations, manually configure epic.name, epic.link, and issue.types.*.handle in the config file

Authentication Methods

Jira CLI supports three authentication types:

    Basic (default): Username and password or API token
    Bearer (PAT): Personal Access Token authentication (requires JIRA_AUTH_TYPE=bearer)
    mTLS: Client certificate authentication for on-premise installations

Multiple Project Support

Use the --config/-c flag or JIRA_CONFIG_FILE environment variable to load specific configurations:

jira issue list --config ~/.config/jira/project2.yml
# or
export JIRA_CONFIG_FILE=~/.config/jira/project2.yml
jira issue list

Configuration File

The configuration is stored in ~/.config/.jira/.config.yml. You can edit this file directly.
Common Commands

# Add comment from file
jira issue comment add PROJ-123 --template comment.md

# Add comment from stdin
echo "Comment text" | jira issue comment add PROJ-123

Worklog and Time Tracking

IMPORTANT: Time tracking estimates are set using the worklog add command with the --new-estimate flag, NOT through custom fields.

# Add time tracking entry
jira issue worklog add PROJ-123 "2d 3h 30m"

# Add worklog with comment
jira issue worklog add PROJ-123 "4h" --comment "Fixed the bug"

# Set remaining estimate when logging work
jira issue worklog add PROJ-123 "1h" --new-estimate "3h"

# Set original estimate (log minimal time with full estimate remaining)
jira issue worklog add PROJ-123 "1m" --new-estimate "8h"

# Complete work and set remaining to 0
jira issue worklog add PROJ-123 "30m" --new-estimate "0m"

# Use --no-input to skip interactive comment prompt
jira issue worklog add PROJ-123 "1h" --new-estimate "2h" --no-input

# Add worklog with start time
jira issue worklog add PROJ-123 "1h 30m" --started "2022-01-01T09:30:00.000+0200" --new-estimate "0h"

Important notes for worklog:

    Cannot log "0m" of time - This causes a server error. Log at least "1m" if you need to set an estimate without logging significant work
    Use --new-estimate to set the remaining time estimate
    The --no-input flag is supported and prevents interactive prompts for comments
    Time formats: "1h", "30m", "1h 30m", "2d 3h 30m"
    Time tracking cannot be set through --custom fields - you must use worklog add with --new-estimate

Search Issues

# Search with JQL
jira issue list --jql "project=PROJ AND status='In Progress' ORDER BY priority DESC"

# Common JQL examples
jira issue list --jql "assignee=currentUser() AND status!=Done"
jira issue list --jql "created >= -7d AND assignee=currentUser()"
jira issue list --jql "priority in (High, Highest) AND status='To Do'"

Interactive UI Navigation

The default list view supports keyboard navigation:

    Arrow keys or j/k/h/l: Navigate up/down/left/right
    g/G: Jump to top/bottom
    CTRL+f/b: Page down/up
    v: View issue details
    m: Transition/move issue to different status
    ENTER: Open issue in browser
    c: Copy issue URL to clipboard
    CTRL+k: Copy issue key to clipboard
    w or TAB: Toggle sidebar focus
    CTRL+r or F5: Refresh list
    ?: Display help

Useful Aliases

Add these to your shell configuration for quicker access:

# List your current issues
alias jira-mine='jira issue list -a$(jira me) -s"To Do,In Progress"'

# Quick view
alias jv='jira issue view'

# List current sprint
alias jira-sprint='jira sprint list --current'

# Open issue quickly
alias jo='jira open'

Advanced Usage
Custom Views

Create custom issue views in ~/.config/jira/.config.yml:

issue:
  fields:
    - key
    - type
    - summary
    - status
    - assignee
    - priority
    - created

Custom Fields

Configure custom field mapping in ~/.config/jira/.config.yml:

custom:
  customfield_10001: Team
  customfield_10002: Story Points

Then use them in commands:

jira issue create --custom Team=Backend,Story\ Points=5

Setting Due Dates

CRITICAL DISTINCTION: Do not confuse due dates with time tracking:

    Due dates (calendar dates): Set via --custom parameter (requires configuration)
    Time tracking (estimates/time spent): Set via jira issue worklog add with --new-estimate flag
    Never try to set time tracking fields (timeoriginalestimate, timetracking, etc.) via --custom - it will not work

IMPORTANT: The duedate field is treated as a custom field and must be explicitly configured to be visible in API responses and usable via the --custom parameter.
Configuration Required for Due Dates

Due dates require special configuration because duedate is a standard Jira field that doesn't appear by default in the Jira CLI API responses. To enable setting and viewing due dates:

    Add the following to your ~/.config/jira/.config.yml:

issue:
  fields:
    custom:
      - name: duedate
        key: duedate
        schema:
          datatype: date

    Then you can set due dates when creating or editing issues:

jira issue create --type Task --summary "Task summary" --custom "duedate=2024-12-31"
jira issue edit PROJ-123 --custom "duedate=2024-12-31"

Requesting Due Dates in API Responses

Without the above configuration:

    The duedate field will NOT appear in jira issue list --raw output
    Attempts to use --custom "duedate=..." will show a warning that the field is "not configured" and will be ignored
    Due dates cannot be set or retrieved via the CLI

With the configuration:

    Due dates will appear in the fields object of JSON responses from --raw output
    You can set due dates using the --custom parameter
    Due dates can be included in custom views

Note: This is a known limitation of the jira-cli tool. See jira-cli issue #698 for more details.
Scripting with Jira CLI

Use raw JSON output for scripting:

#!/bin/bash
# Get all high priority issues
jira issue list --jql "priority=High" --raw | jq -r '.issues[].key'

# Count issues by status
jira issue list --plain --no-headers | awk '{print $4}' | sort | uniq -c

Templates

Create markdown templates for issues and comments:

# Issue template (issue-template.md)
## Description
What needs to be done?

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

# Use template
jira issue create --template issue-template.md

Troubleshooting
Authentication Issues

# Re-initialize configuration
jira init --force

# Check current user
jira me

# Verify API token is set
echo $JIRA_API_TOKEN

Connection Issues

# Test connection
jira issue list --limit 1

# Enable debug mode
JIRA_DEBUG=1 jira issue list

Clear Cache

# Clear cached data
rm -rf ~/.config/jira/.cache

Time Tracking Errors

Error: "field not on the appropriate screen"

    This occurs when trying to set time tracking via --custom fields
    Solution: Use jira issue worklog add with --new-estimate instead
    Time tracking fields cannot be set via the edit command

Error: "Internal server error" (500) when logging time

    Usually caused by trying to log "0m" of time
    Solution: Log at least "1m" - you cannot log zero time
    Example: jira issue worklog add PROJ-123 "1m" --new-estimate "8h"

Warning: "field is not configured" for timeoriginalestimate/timetracking

    This appears when using --custom for time tracking fields
    Solution: Ignore the warning - use worklog add command instead
    Do NOT try to configure these as custom fields - they're managed differently

Error: "invalid transition state" when closing issues

    Status names vary by project/workflow
    Common mistake: Using "Done" when the actual state is "Resolved" or "Closed"
    Solution: Check the error message for available states
    Or view the issue in browser: jira open PROJ-123

Notes

    The Jira CLI uses the Jira REST API under the hood
    API tokens are more secure than passwords and are the recommended authentication method
    Most commands support --help for detailed usage information
    Supports both Jira Cloud and on-premise installations
    Output is converted from Atlassian Document Format to markdown for better terminal display
